# Create a python program to create a flashcard using object-oriented programming. A flashcard is a two-sided card with information on both sides that can assist memory. A question and an answer are usually printed on one side of a flashcard. Follow these steps to complete the activity - 1. From the user, take the input for a word and its definition. 2. To assign values for Word and Meaning, create a class called flashcard and use the __init__() function. 3. We'll use the __str__() function to get a string with the term and its definition. 4. Save the strings that have been returned in a list. 5. To print all of the stored flashcards, use a while loop.
class flashcard ():
    def __init__(self,word,meaning):
        self.word = word
        self.meaning = meaning
    def __str__(self):
        return self.word+'('+ self.meaning+')'
flash = []
print("Welcome to the most boring flashcard application")
while (True):
    word = input("Enter the name for boring flashcard")
    meaning = input("Enter the meaning of the boring word")
    flash.append(flashcard(word,meaning))
    option = int(input("enter 0 , if you want to add another flashcard otherwise enter 1 :"))
    
    if(option):
        break
print("Your boring flashcards")
for i in flash:
    print(">",i)
